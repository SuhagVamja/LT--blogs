"_ **Make it work, make it right, make it fast." ‚Äì Kent Beck.** _

From the abacus to the VCR, we've moved through decades of technical evolution. Some of us still remember the time when there was no computer or any other digital equipment around, except for equipment like the refrigerator.

Nowadays, any place can be home to a supercomputer, and you don't even need to know how to use it.

_ **The question is, how did this happen?** _ **ü§î**

The unnatural evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased exponentially, and many companies proclaim that AI will be the future. This is all because of just one reason, i.e., _PROGRAMMING._

Modern society is built on clever bits of software, but behind every clever app, there are some people who have dedicated many hours of their lives to make our lives easier.

_ **Who are these people?** _ **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

Here's a hint:üß©

You are one of the millions who use software to plan, analyze, strategize, facilitate, and report. Well, you are not alone. If you are reading this article, you are using at least one application or software.

And we all know who they are!

_PROGRAMMERS_

It's not every day that you get to celebrate a holiday, and programmers are no exception.

Since 2002, a day dedicated to programmers (or Programmer's Day) has been celebrated on the 256th day of the year, and there is a reason behind it. Let's go back into the history:

## **The History of Programmers' Day** [
### üìö
](https://emojipedia.org/books/)

Programmers' Day, a holiday that honors computer programmers and software developers dates back to Russia in 2002. That year, Valentin Balt and Michael Cherviakov working for a software company called Parallel Technologies, petitioned the government of Russia for an official holiday to honor the contributions of all coders.

In Russia, this holiday is celebrated on January 21st. In 2008, President Vladimir Putin made it an official festival in Russia by signing a decree praising the contributions of all Russian coders and computer experts.

Unfortunately, it wasn't until September 11, 2009, that the idea became a reality. However, the man responsible for making Programmers' Day a reality is none other than the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of Russia (at the time), Dmitry Medvedev.

## **When does Programmers' Day take place?** [

Celebrated on the 256th day of the year (September 12th within a leap year and September 13th within a general year), Programmers' Day commemorates the date programmer Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language. However, many people celebrate this day on January 7th, which seems to be the original (though unofficial) date for the celebration.

Unconsidered by the general public, the number 256 is very important in programming. Needless to say, Geeks and Programmers know the real potential of 0 and 1. The number 256 is used in the binary system. It is one of the numbers that can be written using an eight-bit byte. Eight is within 365, which are days in a year.

According to ProgrammerDay.info, _"If you are a programmer, you will notice that 1111 1111 is 255 rather than 256. However, the code is correct because it is the 256th value. January 1st is 0000 0000, so if you celebrate Programmer Day on the 255th day, you're guilty of an off-by-one error."_

Now, we know why and when the Programmers' Day is celebrated. It's a special day to show your affection and appreciation for programmers. Remember that all they ever ask is to be respected, appreciated, and recognized for their hard work in building the applications that enhance our lives.
